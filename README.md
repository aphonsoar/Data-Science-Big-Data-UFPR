Title: Customer behavior: a case study of one company that provides digital accounting services. 

This research proposes to be a first step in a larger project of customer success, in a company that provides digital accounting services. It is a case study from its current scenario. Inside the company, staff believe that through data and machine learning techniques, they could get important insights and information that could guide projects, actions plans and support the decision making process, which might help company to provide better services and improve customer experience. From obtained results, company gets material for further exploratory analysis and discover new ways to develop its objectives. Young companies, that operate in innovative and disruptive business models, have a lack of benchmarks to follow or inspire themselves, as there are practically no peers or similar experiences in this market. Through the results of this research, it was possible to identify there are differences between customer profiles, as well in the way they interact with the company. In this context, this research suggests a methodology for analyzing customer profile data and how they interact with the company. Through this, the company is able to develop new actions, either on processes or technology, that could improve the full customer experience.
